# | TAC | Tesla Auto Charge

## Under construction...

TAC is a Python Flask-based application for automatically charging your electrical vehicle during the cheapest electrical spot hours of the day.

By using the day-ahead prices from Nord Pool and the JSON-query API for your Tesla, the application is able to optimize the automated charging to the cheapest hours of the day.

TAC is designed to lower the power demand at expensive times of the day, so that it does not only lower the power bill for the Tesla owners, it affects everyone!

Open-source and free to use!
